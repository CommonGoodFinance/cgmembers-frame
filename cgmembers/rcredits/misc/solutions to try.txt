When things go inexplicably amuck in Drupal 
-- especially if it works offline but not on the production server, try these solutions:

top tag is <?php not <?
no bottom tag
lowercase all drupal functions, module function, and filenames (and all references to them)
do menu_rebuild()
reinstall
clear cache
delete all records from sessions
delete custom files and let the install process re-create them
delete relevant records from system table, menu_router, menu_links,
show source

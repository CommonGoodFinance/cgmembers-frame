David:

to do:
- employee ID cards are US mailed to employee.
- employerÂ´s ok is authoritative (employee's ok is merely request to employer)
- track 3 buys and one sale before rTrader (in membership form)
- use mdash for virtual transactions r%
- non-automatic virtual payments are <<pending>> payments, unseen by recipient (don't implement yet)
- bounce processing (separate?)
- check execution time compared to PHP timeout on daily cron and warn admin

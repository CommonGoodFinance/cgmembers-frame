rCredits
=================

rCredits™ are a community-centered payment system with incentive rewards: for individuals, local businesses, and the community. The purpose is greater local control of community economics, so we can make our communities everything we want them to be.
They are a project of Common Good Finance, a nonprofit charitable organization.

The rPOS app works very much like credit card processing apps for swipe cards. Except instead of a swipe card reader you use your smartphone's camera vision to scan a QR code on the customer's rCard. And instead of paying a 2-3% processing fee, you get incentive rewards.

You can also use the rPOS app to give refunds or exchange rCredits for US Dollars.

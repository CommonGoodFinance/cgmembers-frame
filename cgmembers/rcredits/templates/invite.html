<h2 style="color:darkgreen;">rCredits Advantages</h2>

<h3 style="color:darkblue;">For Individuals</h3>
<ul style="line-height:150%;">
<li><b>Incentive rewards:</b> $20 for signing up, 10% back on whatever you buy with rCredits, and a 10% bonus on your pay.</li>
<li><b>Protection from inflation.</b> Inflation-rate return on your account balance &mdash; currently 5% APR.</li>
<li><b>Easy purchases.</b> Your rCard is all you need, to make purchases in stores. You can also make purchases or send invoices using a web browser, text message, or smartphone.</li>
<li><b>Zero-interest loans.</b> Everyone gets short-term loans on demand, at no cost.</li>
<li><b>Guaranteed value.</b> Trade your rCredits for US Dollars as needed.</li>
<li><b>Financial security**.</b> The rCredits system is designed to serve as the framework for a Common Good Economy; that is, a new sustainable, democratic funding system that puts people and planet first -- a model easily adopted by individuals and businesses in any community, so everyone can have healthy food, a home, healthcare, satisfying work, and a livable world.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:darkblue;">For Businesses:</h3>
<ul style="line-height:150%;">
<li><b>No processing fees.</b> Save 2-4% on credit card fees. rCredits charges are free.</li>
<li><b>Fast, easy transactions.</b> Use a smartphone or tablet to scan the customer's rCard.</b> rCredits transactions take about the same time as a credit card transaction. Funds go into your account immediately.</li>
<li><b>Incentive rewards.</b> 10% back on payments you make in rCredits and a 10% reward on whatever you sell.</li>
<li><b>Protection from inflation.</b> Continuous inflation-rate return on your account balance &mdash; currently 5% APR.</li>
<li><b>Short-term credit.</b> rCredits give you an interest-free line of credit for easier cash flow.</li>
<li><b>Online advertising.</b> List your products and services free on the rCredits website.</li>
<li><b>Supports "buy local".</b> The whole community has a stake in your success.</li>
<li><b>Easy bookkeeping.</b> Your rCredits account works like an online bank account.</li>
<li><b>Access to capital**.</b> Apply for zero-interest loans for business expansion or startup.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:darkblue;">For Communities**</h3>
<ul style="line-height:150%;">
<li><b>More funding for sustainability, culture, and human needs.</b> Communities can issue rCredits as needed, to flourish economically and socially.</li>
<li><b>We decide together what to finance and what to fund.</b> Communities gather to plan what organizations to support and what local businesses to create or expand. We can make those plans together, knowing we can issue rCredits to fund them &mdash; as grants, equity investments, or zero-interest loans.</li>
<li><b>A democratic process that leads toward consensus.</b> rCredits communities use a combination of democratic processes: town meeting-style discussions, voting directly or with personal representatives (one person one vote), ranked choices, instant runoff, and approval voting. The outcome leaves as many people satisfied as possible. </li>
<li><b>Stability.</b> The funding we issue together benefits everyone. It does not increase the wealth of a few at the expense of the many. The system gets more and more stable and sustainable as it grows. </li>
<li><b>We can look after our own and help others.</b> With the power to issue credits that act like money, we can take on that responsibility and be effective in building a Common Good Economy and a society to benefit everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>** <i>Longer term advantages</i> will start once the rCredits system has been stable for at least six months.</p>

<p>Here is a direct link to the rCredits website: <a href="http://rCredits-org.com">rCredits</a>. But DO NOT EVER click on an email link to a website where you have account information. It is probably an attempt to discover your personal information and steal your identity or your money. Or both. Don't do it.</p>

<p>Instead, type the rCredits website address (rCredits.org) in the address bar at the top of your browser window.</p>

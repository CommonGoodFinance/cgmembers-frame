 * rCredits
 *
 * A module for the rCredits financial system.
 * This module implements rCredits as an extension to Community Accounting (mcapi).
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Specifically, this module keeps track of and manages the following:
 * - balances: how much credit each participating individual or enterprise has been given,
 *             toward future goods and services
 * - credit lines: how much advance credit each participant has been (or is to be) granted, with
 *             the expectation that they will produce commensurate goods and services
 * - transactions: exchanges of credit for goods and services or for other types of credit
 * - credit issuance: how credit comes into being, before it is used in transactions
 *
 * CREDIT ISSUANCE:
 * In the rCredits system, credit is always issued as a Ricardian Contract
 * (see http://www.systemics.com/docs/ricardo/issuer/contract.html).
 * Initially, for the first 6 months, credit will be issued only by the Society to Benefit Everyone, Inc.,
 * for rebates, bonuses, and inflation adjustments. That credit will be backed by the membership
 * promise of each participant.
 *
 * After 6 months, we expect that Common Good Communities will be the sole issuers of rCredits.
 * At that time, all participants will exchange their rCredits one-for-one for new rCredits issued
 * jointly by themselves (that is, by their Common Good Community). The new contract will spell out
 * the financial relationship between Common Good Communities.
 *
 * STRUCTURE:
 * rCredits is the central engine
 * separate modules handle the various transaction channels: rSMS, rSmartphone, rBrowser, etc.
 * rIssue handles credit issuance.
 * 
 * a companion module, rDemocracy, handles participatory financial decision-making

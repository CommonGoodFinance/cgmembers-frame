  . added "From Bank" and "Fees" to Transaction History
  . all Dwolla fees will now be reimbursed by the community (unless reimbursed by Dwolla). This also fixes problems with accurate USD balance caching
  . fixed bug in r\nextRBuyer() that prevented members from buying rCredits if they had transactions but had never traded USD for rCredits (patched on production server)

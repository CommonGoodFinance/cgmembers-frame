// Feature: Track commands
//   AS a player
//   I WANT the system to count how many times I use each SMS command
//   SO I can fulfill my membership requirements
//   
//   AS a system administrator
//   I WANT the same thing
//   SO I can tell how much the various commands are used And can detect anomalies
//   NOTE: the various forms of each command should be tracked separately, especially "to" or "from" (1) without "for", (2) with "for cash" and (3) with "for" something else.

rCredits Software
To Do

- form publicity committee (as decided by the board)
- rCredits gift card (essentially an invitation from another member, but with a printed $50 value (if you use this card for purchases at GFM, Foster's, or the Barn)
- Help Upinngil get books set up right
- Use BeenVerified.com routinely
- Get a security audit
- Offer new businesses guaranteed bonus (hundreds or thousands) for signing up and trying it. "We're so sure it will benefit you, we will write you a check for $4,000 to give it a try."
- FAQs for promo site (under Why rCredits)
- "rCredits Accepted Here" register stickers (4x2")
- (from mike morton) after we grow, might be nice to do newsletter features on:
        • the person who’s successfully directly invited the most other people
        • ditto, but directly-and-indirectly combined, sort of “most descendants”
        • the longest chain of successful invites (probably not that long, so maybe more than one chain)
- Once we have an office: apply to the MA Executive Office of Health and Human Services Dept. of Transitional Assistance for Community Service Volunteers (on site)
- create CGF retirement account with reward pct "rebate" = 0

. *** don't log email addresses (just qid or '?')
. * ANY unused subdomain should redirect to new.rcredits.org if scanned
. **** general purpose email link for companies to invite their members or customers to join rCredits (
(https://new.rcredits.org/signup/code=whatever/e=customeremail@example.com -- good for 30 days) Implement same as other invites, but don't check invitee and don't ever mark it used, if accepted with an email address
. ** create a demo site (demo.rcredits.org) that people can create accounts on, scan demo cards (and sign in as cAdmin?)
. *** separate emails for separate purposes (with good subject) and settable preferences

. *** make an easy way for admin to change an account's region (and community) [easier than f('r.changeUid', $uid);]
. *** sometimes we receive two same-second identical transaction requests from the app -- not forced. ask experts why and figure out a way to prevent it.
. *** the wrong transactions require approval on reversal (maybe)
. *** for appData requests, target a specific device (or each device for a particular business) and record the results in r_boxes
. *** store company card security code in relations table, not cardcode2 (for example, if an agent of multiple companies loses a Company Agent card, we don't want to have to replace all their Company Agent rCards)

. for staff always show channel and agent
. cache non-automatic r for pre-CGC cttys
. download to app 100 one-use cardcodes

. refactor statement, and memberId classes to extend whatever is common among them, while revising statement and memberId
. do not allow companies to draw from bank (yet)?
. in cron, if any created date in r_txs is more than two days (48 hours) off from its predecessor, tell admin about it (including how far off): get min xid0 in past 3 days, select xid where xid>xid0 but created<now-3days
. don't make account opener manager if "by" is ADMIN or cadmin (and give account a temp password)
. * add a Pay button to member company rCredits webpage
. moves is off by one when current county does not appear in ss-search list
. when admin changes "goods"ness of a transaction, data gets double-serialized (don't. and look for data starting "{{")
. when admin enters data from paper, remember it was paper (risk bit), present the "Add Another Account" button, ask for inviter (accept an email or name), offer a single checkbox for "signed", etc.
. make moves and tenure editable fields on Summary
. force=-1 does not get recorded in the reversing transaction!
. somehow two identical grocery purchases were recorded for Nancy Hazard, from one POS request (not forced). One was later reversed by the device. Try to detect and prevent that (don't accept two charge requests from a single device within a few seconds of each other? wait a sec?) (handle as well as possible from both ends)
. combine txedit with txInfo form and allow editing of txAdminOk bit (only), along with amount, goods, and for. 
. for business accounts, the how-to-sign-in email should mention signing in to PERSONAL acct and choosing the company from the dropdown in the upper right corner
. setting either adminOk or txAdminOk should record who did it in notes (for acct) or data (for tx)

. let cAdmin2 see history without changing account (like for memberInfo)
. see whether 2nd-degree invitees behave any differently from 1st degree
. simplify what happens when user selects an account from the dropdown (should be fast)

. annual tax ack for sharing rewards
. bug: changing Preston's notice frequency works, but does not say "saved" and the spinner persists.
. forbid unauthorized signed-out transactions (in smart.inc), because app accidentally allowed a refund by a cashier without being signed in.
. make a changeUid interface for Admin: select account1 from lookup box, go to separate page to input target community
. improve "send another invite" message so people click the link.
. bankless accounts that draw on others are forbidden to cash out, (but they can draw rewards from other accounts).
. add graphs 2-4 to the account statements in a "Community" section, with short explanations of the significance.

. Jesse Seaver says: 

1. The first line of a new account shouldn’t say my account fell below the sufficient balance. Because I am a new user, it should say “Initial Deposit” or something like that. 

2. Cant the link to the account be set up so that it has parameters that tell the server that after login it should goto the specified settings page? 

3. Make your call to offer to help them ( email, phone, chat ) at the very top of the message. This immediately ( even if a little subconsciously ) implies that their satisfaction is the most important thing. 

4. Attach it as a PDF as well, or offer a link so I Can print it easily. 

5. Can I have a QR code that will pull up my Rcredit profile, or a way to pay me in credits via a mobile app / mobile site? 

6. Add icons to the balance listing, or at least + and - signs in red or green depending on whether it’s a debit or credit. 

. for rebates/bonuses, give xid# for ctty purpose (eg "rebate on #3847")
. maybe change relations qid to company QID dot letter, like NEW.AAB.A, meaning <first employee of the AAB company> (relations table will need a company sequence number). This will allow the app to distinguish companies offline.
. rdo for min needs expires date (all entries should have an expires date)
. add link to explanation of rCredits staying in the system on Summary and Bank pages
. bug: memberInfo form shows "can ?" for Emily on Adam's record
. remove invoicing code from be\transfer (but crash if called inappropriately)
. leave erroneous export fields blank and don't leave a dangling "-" on zip
. add "check online" to the ticklers
. handle failed deposits/withdrawals (notify the member)
. establish ways to prove we know who the member is (show photo, etc)
. link on signup pages "Skip this step and return to Checklist"
. graph improvements:
  - (from mike) might be interesting to show on the statistics page not only the number of signed up users but also lines for how many have used their card in the last 30 days. Or any other way to measure activity.
. for businesses: send them a customized QR with a "rCredits accepted here" sign (every member website should link to the rCredits promo site AND have a pay button)
. The meaning of "cashing out" should include only: (1) trading rCredits for USD at an official rCredits exchange (a member business that has agreed to provide that service) and (2) transferring funds to one's connected bank account.
. prevent foul codes from getting assigned to new members
. when reversing a sharing in ws., reversed tx gets wrong tid in purpose and offsetting tx does not appear (BAD)
. track buyers and sellers in stats: SELECT DISTINCT uid,fullName FROM r_txs t, users u WHERE uid IN (payer, payee) AND uid>1 AND payee<>26742000000002 AND payer>0
. scatter graph: sector II x-axis buyers (primarily) pay y-axis sellers (primarily). sector I y-axis sellers pay x-axis buyers (mostly payroll), order by how extreme ($bought-$sold), with extremes on the top/outside
. Adam: I've noticed the rcredits member site keeps me logged in long after I've stopped using it, even after I close the tab and then reopen it hours or days later. For a financial site where money can be moved, I'd recommend either auto-logout after 10-20 minutes of inactivity, or (better) requiring me to re-enter my password before doing certain things like paying people if it's been more than 10-20 min since I last entered it. 
. implement a FREEZE button for cttyadmins (disables transfers of USD out)
. change cached "r" field in users to bal
. use legalName on Relations page!!
. Pay page does not figure shortfall properly (omits draw!)
. If Matt leaves his phone untouched for X minutes and Sheila picks it up, should it insist that she sign in? Or at least say “Are you still Matt?” ?
. Should we not allow you to undo the last transaction if it was more than Y minutes ago?
. make "back to member list" link on member info page go to bookmark for the edited account
. fix messy security page for admins
. make some Preferences "advanced"
. add "[?]" to "cash/loan/etc", linking to more info -- including an example of reimbursement
. let other communities have a list of not-yet-members?
. require PIN for purchases over $x. (requires a change to App also)
. option to send text message on purchase
- * detailed membership tests: New Pass, Photo, Agreement, Donate, Proxies, Usd, proof of ID, Options

. maybe change tx type from TX_SIGNUP to TX_PIONEER for early txs where payerFor='pioneer bonus'
. add link to the agreement on rCredits.org
. give admin tweak msg upon SHOWING bank form
- ** implement r\suggest (use this for merchant invoices too. user gets an email invoice from rCredits, they can just click a link to accept or decline. merchant gets notified). test cron call to r\suggest (should just notify, for now)

. Suggestions from Mike:
• I think I had to click “Upload and Save” twice, once to upload-and-display, once to save. Is that correct?
• The place which now shows a teeny photo was a [-] before. Confusing. Omit it from the web page entirely?
• The phrase “Checking accounts work best because of legal restrictions on other types” But why not attach that warning to the second radio button? Just “(these won’t work as well as checking accounts…)” ?
• The full-contact-info page asked again whether to verify by text or voice. Does it really need to know that?
• Instead of “Choose File” in the upload-photo page, how about “Choose Photo”? (make input an invisible overlay): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5191375/a-file-input-button-for-all-browsers-is-this-possible/5191970#5191970

. To handle a “run” on rCredits, Community Admins should be able to freeze rCredits/USD exchanges until the community has an opportunity to meet to discuss solutions.
• routing number and federal ID: could be nice to light up when I have the correct number of digits.
. make proxy choices scrolling lists (with html size=20 ?), maybe the two choices side by side
. create an rCredits charge&pay app (modify rPOS) for members to charge or pay other members (rather than be charged). It might be expanded later to include account features.
. implement two-factor signin
. write ajax to remember country and state in Contact form, on blank field error
 don't create account (in acct class) if email is a dup
. handle cards reported stolen at POS (how? ask Visa)
. on transaction page: action on far left, reward next to "to you"
. cash/loan/etc vs. goods & services: provide a link to help the member decide which
. sort transactions by date before download (already does, for display)
. report proper balance on tellStaff about gift
. allow user to change box name (can change computer box name only if currently on that computer)
- * reduce picture size and make thumbnails (for upper right corner)
. check and correct deposit/withdrawal status (and balance) when visiting bank tab
. selecting a new account when site has timed out and signed the user out, should do something reasonable
. take B_BONA off region and add B_CO
. fix layout of member webpage (description gets jammed into narrow div)
. send a statement to each member monthly. if it bounces, call, then shut down the account 7 days later (with a notice) and send a text immediately and/or US Mail pcard later, saying we need a new email address (with easy instructions for doing it, including what to do if they don't remember their password (first make an exchange of a certain amount of cash for rC at a member business, as an identity check?, then go online and use that as their temp pw)
. no cardcode for businesses (in acct class)
. no password for businesses
. start with 0 bal, charge customer $20, then undo. fails.
. explain yellow highlight on Relations page
. *** omit "request rCard" on relations page if account has not been approved
. LATER add option for company to enable access by others to their device(s). But default to no access. That way, an unsigned-in cashier can't accidentally sign in another company's agent. ("restricted" field in r_boxes? B_READ means "can use our rPOS devices" in relations form?) May require a A.testDevice param in rPOS.
. give stage server hidden fields! (currently crashes on $a->dob)
. * when user has no access to the page, show login page if user is not logged in (requires a change to Drupal)
. * write rweb feature tests for automatic one-click actions (see rcron/features/old/SoldOut.feature for an example)
- * help for all pages
- * in daily: alert staff if deposit / withdrawal not complete after 5 days

. any account can unilaterally charge an account it has permission to draw on
. company search on production server gets collation error (search for "food") (not critical)
. hover help on relations page
. committed amount can go negative (on a refund). make sure cron handles it right.
. Fix this problem in tests: Too many args (11) in statement: next random code is ""dxCX>tz0Asz4@,8F=I6u6Ng_p}1U[6cZfitLjNd[X1WmC8BpD"" (maybe in test-defs.php? subargs are recognized by "=>", so it's not that...)

. drive xml error from USPS on Signin, and handle it gracefully
. rewrite form testing system to use just menu_execute_active_handler, drupal_validate_form, etc. (assuring official behavior). For example, be able to test required fields.
. (later) suggest reaching out to increase rebate pct
. handle menu logout from restricted page (does not log out)
. (later) use rc4.me for login and email redirection (with forward.php). Database table accounts has fields email (primary), username (all lowercase letters), and region (3 or 4 uppercase letters). So user can log in at rc4.me (linked to by rcredits.org), which then forwards the request to the appropriate server. Scanned cards go directly to the proper server (new.rc2.me/A/AAAcode OR /a/... for agents, B&b for 4-letter users, etc.).
. add to misc.js: for each text input on the page, if the current value includes "XX-", make it silver. onEnter, zap the contents (set .length=0 ?)
. when there is an error, don't make user retype the hidden fields (so soc sec and dob should not be password type) (also when error happens in submit, because there is a dwolla error)
. warn admin when changing to rTrader prematurely, that it may cause double withdrawal from bank (happened to Dan)
- when contesting a tx, ask for comment (add it to payer's "for"). The next day (and thereafter) don't allow editing the for. Include payer's note in notice to payee.
- LATER (when available) tests with dev sandbox and reg sandbox!
- move SMS notices option to cell form (and add field to r_boxes)?
- on MSIE 8, sign-in CSS has alignment problem, menu failure in MSIE 8, autocomplete looks funny
- LATER give user a chance to name the machine
* LATER prefs: "Show address (show my address to companies I pay or donate to)" -- just assume TRUE for now. 
- combine channel and box on Transaction History?
- warn people about their tax liability (ask what their tax year is? warn in December?)
- trans history: default today on starting/ending and/or pass true defaults properly for period
- no rebate / bonus for manager of company with no (other) employees (set bit?)
- add a login field to relations and record last login time of agent/company pair
- return error from u\httpRequest() (instead of u\EXPECT), throw hiddenData error in acct::offsiteData(). Catch it on Summary screen at least (display gentle Warning message).
- account checks: auto-deposit or minimum>0 but not connected to checking account yet: notice to user
- block repeated 404s
- pagination for trans history
- recommend password practices
- handle 10-day interval for deposits/withdrawals for non-checking accounts
- Hilary's list
- * don't allow clicking on links in emails (send to new.rcredits_org.com/whatever, which looks like rcredits.org but scolds the user for clicking on an email link, then offers a link to the real site (don't accept that one either). Exception: links that do not require sign-in (for example, suggested account changes and merchant charges -- merchant creates invoice. no shipping until you accept it -- like paypal).
- create region records as needed, when a new member is outside NEW. Handle region totals in r\total()
- in r\transact() we should rollback the transaction if it leaves the payer in unauthorized debt (due to a timing error that might be exploited intentionally by a determined hacker)
- Maybe remove security algorithms from public view (see https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data)
- add share to summary page, for admins (or allow $0 donation and don't record it)
- receive deposit/withrawal callbacks to set "completed" in r_usd. alert staff if fails.
- demo button on rcredits.org goes to login with options to log in as abeone, beatwo (self-employed), cornerpub, or townarts (which should have a "Donate" form on its member/townarts page)
- "sign" our invite emails so gmail and others won't see them as spam (needed?)
- give ctty admin a way to reset a member's password (assign them a one-time pass, set a one-time bit)
- /password should give error if user is logged in
- back button
- revisit t\addAttrib and t\snapshot (does Drupal make ids lowercase?)
- nightly: recalc exchange rates / allow users to express amounts in any currency (rounding DOWN); transactions will need to record exchange rate (true currency will be tied to region, regardless of how the user chooses to have it displayed)
- how much can the community safely create? this depends on velocity of circulation and two kinds of demand: 
    (1) company/employee/contractor demand and (2) other (by people who have no rCredits income source)
    The first kind reflects the inherent strength of the system, the second should be seen as backup
    We can create the amount of the first kind divided by velocity, probably.
- travel checks (use once, limited amount)
- allow extra params in buynow form
- for companies, show HTML for online payment buttons
- make personal contact info secure?
- Company profile picture will also appear in our office slideshow. Say so on company tab.
- (2013-02-13) i had a dream last night that peace prevailed among the human planets because a benign alien race provided a way to verify the identity of any speaker. This morning the following ideas came to me, about how to approach that ideal. Members should be able to choose their security method:
  . whenever the transaction is between accounts from different regions, in-person merchant must ask the customer for a "travel word". The system reports a new travel word (for next time) that the merchant then tells the customer.
  . the foreign in-person merchant can ask for a PIN (that doesn't change)
  . the customer must show a separate photo ID
  . the customer must pay with an ad-hoc smartphone QR, rather than a card (best). The QR is valid for only 2 minutes (and only once).
  . either in-person or online, the customer must verify the purchase by text message or email (within 2 minutes or so)
  . online, no extra security for requests from the usual machine/IP/cookie. Otherwise customer must first go to the rcredits website separately and log in (you can create an icon, to make this easy).
  . different options may apply for different charge amounts. Rate the "level" of each method and suggest appropriate levels/defaults for (rounded) price ranges (0-5, 6-25, 26-100, 101-500, 501-2500, 2501+)
  . "Protect yourself from identity theft: (give standard tips, plus:) As long as you are using rCredits on *this machine*, we will not need to ask you any security questions. Do not sign in to rCredits on a machine you don't trust. If you must, then as soon as you get home, check your transaction history and change your password and security questions. If you are shopping online at a non-local site, when it comes time to pay, make sure you are really on the rCredits site (show what to look for).
  . (when the member buys something online from a foreign site, from an unusual machine, ALWAYS require confirmation by email. Do not show settings except from home machine)
- relation.class
- Coding security policy: never show any personal identifying info (R_SECRET_FIELDS) in the HTML. EVER. For example, when verifying someone's identity, the staff member should ask for the last 4 of their ss#, type it in and press submit. The code does a compare and returns just yes or no. Even the member cannot ever see what they earlier typed in. We might want to have a similar but weaker restriction on phone numbers and addresses -- like maybe those are protected for personal accounts. When 1099 time comes, the reports go out electronically only (no preview, etc.) Even user 1 and other admins don't have access to PII. Also put in some safe-guards to prevent repetitive guessing.
- beef up security 
- Let's hope that by the time we get a DoS attack on a regional rCredits server, we're big enough to hire competent people to fight it. As a corollary, we probably want to encourage regions to use large hosting companies rather than small local ones. Unfortunately.

  We will also want a way to cope with internet outages (local or national). (David this paragraph is mostly for you, after the next sentence.) The current plan is to develop a mobile app that saves a working copy of the entire system in a distributed network (of smart devices) with lots of redundancy. For example, we want each merchant's device(s) to recognize their repeat customers. Each new customer who pays with a smart device (rather than a card) (which we will encourage at some point, perhaps by giving people an extra $5 if they forgo the card, or an extra penny per transaction) brings data to the merchant:
  some encrypted gem that gets passed from member to member on each transaction, to prove their identity and/or balance and/or connection to the merchant's community
  miscellaneous (encrypted) transaction data to add to the merchant's records. (This might just be a second purpose for the same data.)
  In such times, even participants without a smart device could be given a paper receipt that is a single large QR code, to carry to their next transaction. Better, they could be given a (re-writable) mag-stripe card (or the equivalent) that the next merchant reads and re-writes.

TODO whenever

- security later: 
  . Make the agent's picture appear from behind the "r", get big, then shrink and settle into place, traveling in the shape of an "r", ideally leaving a jet trail.
  . How to prove the logged-out site is rcredits? Maybe always ask first "It looks like you came here from an rCredits member site. Make sure this is the real rCredits website! Does your url bar say https://new.rcredits.org? Does it show a security symbol? We will display this reminder only once in a while. Don't let the identity thieves get you. Be sure to check the url bar <i>every time</i>."
@todo: add videos, like this:
  <video width="320" height="240" controls autoplay>
    <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag. (maybe embed a clickable vid in an iframe here?)
  </video>

@todo: move some util functions, like ray(), to rcredits-basic.inc and "USE" them everywhere without a namespace qualifier.
@todo: allow surrounding spaces on all web input, leading dollar signs in amounts. Test. (mostly done)
@todo: we also need some kind of confirmation on foreign transactions (from the other server)
@todo: store city code (rather than city), with a code for "other" -- store other in data or r_other (same for country/state) MAYBE
@todo: reporting for a community or server (a form that anyone can use)
@todo: download transactions in other standard formats
@todo: Finish separating backend. Front end should have no registered users.
@todo: use popups for some things
@todo: make help divs draggable
@todo: option to suppress current balance in messages (make it a separate message) B_SHOWBAL (default TRUE)
@todo: Miscellaneous other data to collect:
  Names and Social Security Numbers of Dependents [and answer: why do we need this?]
@todo: closed accounts have only read perm and point (data[new_account]) at new account qid
@todo: servers exchange info on which ss#s (or other ids) are dups
@todo
- remove all direct db operations from interface modules (and their .inc files) -- use be\ and u\ there, but not r\

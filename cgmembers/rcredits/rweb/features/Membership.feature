Feature: Membership
AS a member
I WANT to manage my progress toward activating my account
SO I can participate actively.

#Special Dwolla magic:
#You can receive emails at any non-@dwolla.com email address.  That means you can make new accounts without me needing to forward the confirmation emails to you.
#Phones are automatically verified, so you don’t need to call VerifyPhone anymore.  You can cause the Verify Phone stage to fail by setting the phone number to 5551234567
#You can fail the SSN now with specific “always fail” SSNs:
#777777777 - will put user in Kba if personal account (if used for commercial account on AuthorizedRep call, will put them in PhotoId since there is no Kba for business acts)
#888888888 - will put user in PhotoId
#999999999 - will put user in AccountInfo

#phone 1 means +1 413.772.0001
